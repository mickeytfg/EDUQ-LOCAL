== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I can't install the plugin =

Please temporarily enable the [WordPress Debug Mode](https://codex.wordpress.org/Debugging_in_WordPress). Edit your `wp-config.php` and set the constants `WP_DEBUG` and `WP_DEBUG_LOG` to `true` and try
it again. When the plugin triggers an error, WordPress will log the error to the log file `/wp-content/debug.log`. Please check this file for errors. When done, don't forget to turn off
the WordPress debug mode by setting the two constants `WP_DEBUG` and `WP_DEBUG_LOG` back to `false`.

= I get a white screen =

Most of the time a white screen means a PHP error. Because PHP won't show error messages on default for security reasons, the page is white. Please turn on the WordPress Debug Mode to turn on PHP error messages (see previous answer).

= I have a different question =

Please contact us via the above "support" tab and add a ticket: please describe your problem as detailed as possible. Include screenshots where appropriate.
Where possible, also include the log file. You can find the log files in `/wp-content/uploads/wc-logs/` or `/wp-content/plugin/woocommerce/logs`.
